/**
 * A session buffer is a circular buffer of buffers. Each buffer has a fixed size and is intended
 * to match the "checkout" size of rrweb. Each individual buffer should contain a valid replay
 * and then the sum of all the buffers should also be a valid replay containing each of the other
 * session chunks.
 *
 * The buffer can continuously capture events while always remaining in a playable state
 * and dropping old events.
