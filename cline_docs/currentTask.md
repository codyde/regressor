# Current Task

## Active Objective
✅ Refactored simulation logic for A/B testing
✅ Updated error rate configuration
✅ Standardized latency simulation
✅ Improved code clarity and documentation

## Implementation Details
1. Error Rate Configuration
   - Normal Mode:
     - 10% error rate for both versions (A and B)
     - Consistent baseline for comparison
   - Extreme Mode:
     - Version A (flightStatus false): 10% error rate
     - Version B (flightStatus true): 80% error rate
     - Tests degraded performance scenarios

2. Latency Simulation
   - Consistent range: 110-130ms
   - Applied to both versions in all modes
   - Provides stable baseline for performance testing

3. Code Improvements
   - Renamed extremeLatency to extremeMode for clarity
   - Simplified error rate calculation logic
   - Enhanced UI feedback and statistics display
   - Improved code organization and readability

## Testing Instructions
1. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
2. Verify Functionality:
   - Test both normal and extreme modes
   - Verify error rates match specifications
   - Confirm latency stays within 110-130ms range
   - Check UI updates and statistics accuracy

3. Test Scenarios:
   - Normal Mode:
     - Both versions should show ~10% error rate
     - Latency should stay within specified range
   - Extreme Mode:
     - Version A should maintain 10% error rate
     - Version B should show ~80% error rate
     - Latency should remain stable
